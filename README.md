# SolvingQuestions
<h3>Welcome, Visitor!</h3>
<p>Here, I'll be randomly uploading my solutions to any problems or questions or algorithms I find online.</p>
<p>I feel it's good sometimes to practise on my algorithmic skills and I find it fun to solve these questions(especially the ones that prevents me from sleep).</p>
<p>My main language(for now) would be Java. Hopefully in the upcoming future I will be using Python or C++ to solve some of the problems.</p>
<p>P.S Feel free to suggest any improvements to my solutions, because I'm still learning.</p>
